# Exam-Management

Welcome to exam management.

### Setup

Simply clone this repository.

There is no other setup needed for this. Have Visual studio installed to run it.

### Info

The website is quite barebones. It uses the ASP.NET MVC template created with `dotnet new mvc`. There is some basic bootstrap styling.
This uses a sqlite database. There is no sample initial data. It has the full CRUD capability, so you shall be able to create sites and sessions and view them in the page. You can then also edit them.
This code doesn't use identity since all actions are Unauthenticated.

Total time taken to create this: 10 hours
