# Exam-Management

Welcome to exam management.

### Setup

There is no setup needed for this. Have Visual studio installed to run it.

### Info

This uses a sqlite database. There is no sample initial data. It has the full CRUD capability, so you shall be able to create sites and sessions and view them in the page. You can then also edit them.
This code doesn't use identity since all actions are Unauthenticated.

Total time taken to create this: 9 hours
